# RASTRA: AI-Based Smart Road Damage Detection, Reporting, and Municipal Management System

RASTRA is an AI-powered system designed to detect, report, and manage road damage in real time. It automatically identifies road issues such as potholes, cracks, and flooding, enables citizens to report problems via mobile or web apps, and helps municipalities prioritize repairs using intelligent, data-driven insights.

## Feature 1 — AI Road Damage Detection

RASTRA leverages **computer vision** (using YOLO and OpenCV) to automatically detect and classify road damage from images or videos.

### Capabilities:
- Detects common road issues: potholes, cracks, flooding, and more  
- Classifies damage type with high accuracy  
- Provides real-time, scalable detection without human intervention  

This enables early identification of deteriorating road conditions before they become safety hazards.

## Feature 2 — Citizen Reporting System

Citizens can report road issues through a user-friendly **web or mobile app** by uploading photos or videos.

### Auto-Tagging Engine:
- **Location**: Automatically tagged using GPS coordinates  
- **Damage Type**: Classifies the issue using AI-powered detection  
- **Severity Level**: Assesses severity using AI output and predefined rules  

✅ This creates a **real-time, verified complaint** without requiring manual verification by officials.

## Feature 3 — Severity Scoring & Priority Engine

RASTRA calculates a dynamic **severity score** for each reported road issue using a combination of factors:

| Factor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Damage size & type | Based on AI classification and damage extent |
| Traffic density | How many vehicles use the road daily |
| Accident risk level | Historical and real-time accident data |
| Public reports count | Aggregated reports from citizens (indicating community concern) |

### Priority Levels:
- **Critical**: Immediate action required (e.g., flooding, large potholes on high-traffic roads)  
- **High**: Urgent but not life-threatening  
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, needs attention within weeks  
- **Low**: Minor issues, low public impact  

This ensures municipalities allocate resources to the most dangerous and high-impact roads first.

## Feature 4 — Municipal Admin Dashboard

Officials access a **centralized, real-time dashboard** to manage all reported road issues efficiently.

### Key Functions:
- View all reported damages in a live, interactive list  
- Filter by: location, damage type, severity, status  
- Track the lifecycle of each issue:  
  - Pending  
  - In-progress  
  - Fixed  
- Monitor performance metrics (e.g., response time, repair completion rate)

✅ Replaces outdated manual systems like paper registers and Excel spreadsheets with a modern, scalable, and transparent workflow.

## Benefits of RASTRA
- Reduces response time for road maintenance  
- Improves public safety through early detection  
- Increases transparency and citizen engagement  
- Enables data-driven decision-making for municipal planning  
- Scalable and deployable across urban and rural areas  

> RASTRA turns road maintenance from a reactive, fragmented process into a proactive, intelligent, and community-driven system.
